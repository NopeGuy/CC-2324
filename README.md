## Overview

This project implements a distributed file sharing system using Java socket programming. It consists of a server and multiple clients that can share files with each other.

## Features

- File Fragmentation: Files are split into blocks to facilitate efficient sharing.
- UDP Communication: UDP is used for efficient block information exchange among clients.
- Mediator Thread: A mediator thread coordinates the exchange of block information between clients and prioritizes those with better connection.
- Menu System: Clients can interact with the system through a simple console menu.
- DNS system: If you configure bind9 in your system you can connect the nodes through their domain names.

## Components
### Server

The server listens for incoming connections from clients, manages client files and block information, and facilitates communication between clients. 

Usage:

```
java Server
```


### Client

Clients connect to the server, share their files, and interact with the distributed file system through a console menu. Also they have a mediator thread that manages the UDP communication between themselves, ensuring efficient exchange of block information.

Usage:

```
java Client
```

### DNS Files

If you're using the DNS version of this project, you should install bind9 beforehand and dump the files inside "/etc/bind/" so there's a working name resolution.

## How to Use

    Start the Server:
        Run the Server class to start the server.

    Connect Clients:
        Run the Client class on multiple machines to connect clients to the server.

    Share Files:
        Clients can share files by placing them in the ClientFiles directory.

    Interact with the Menu:
        Clients can interact with the system through the console menu:
            Option 1: Ask for a file location.
            Option 2: Download a file.
            Option 3: Exit.

Dependencies

    Java SDK 8 or later.

Notes

    The project is currently configured to use the default server IP address (10.0.0.10) or Domain Name (Servidor1.cc23) and port (9090). Update these values in the Client class if needed.
